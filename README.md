# CarbonCounter
We live in a world where carbon emissions are proving to be problematic. Thus, we created a new application named Carbon Counter which tracks an individuals carbon footprint.
But it is just not that. With this tracking, we intend to leverage the potential amount of CO2 emissions saved into creating carbon credits. These carbon credits can then be used to generate monetary benefits.

This project was created as part of LAHacks.
